### üèõ Faculty of Computer Science
Gradueted from the University of Buenos Aires in Computer Science in 2023. For the final thesis project I analysed statistically 456 historical jazz solos, and devised various ways of creating graphs with them.  
Worked on many projects with a group of fellow students as part of the lectures we were taking. We made specs from each poject guidelines, writing the software from those specs, and making extensive testing shown afterwards on a comprehensive report, with graphics and conclusions.
